# CRM Admin Automation Framework

> Playwright · TypeScript · Cucumber BDD · Allure · GitHub Actions

A production-grade end-to-end automation framework for the CRM Admin dashboard — Products module. Built with a dual-layer approach: Playwright spec files for technical depth and Cucumber BDD for business-readable scenarios, both sharing the same Page Object layer.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd crm-automation
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:

```env
BASE_URL=https://qa-mdashboard.dev.gokwik.in
LOGIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
LOGIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
LOGIN_OTP=123456
MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id
HEADLESS=true
SLOW_MO=0
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=30000
NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT=60000
```

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env` — it is gitignored. Credentials must only live in `.env` locally and in GitHub Secrets for CI.

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Playwright Spec Tests

```bash
# Full suite (cleans allure-results before running)
npm test

# Smoke tests only — fast, ~3 min
npm run test:smoke

# Full regression suite
npm run test:regression

# Products module only
npm run test:products

# Auth/login tests only
npm run test:auth

# Network resilience tests
npm run test:network

# With browser visible — useful for debugging
npm run test:headed

# Step-through debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Playwright interactive UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

### Cucumber BDD Scenarios

```bash
# All scenarios (cleans allure-results before running)
npm run cucumber

# Smoke scenarios only
npm run cucumber:smoke

# Regression scenarios only
npm run cucumber:regression
```

> All `npm test` and `npm run cucumber` commands automatically clean `allure-results/` before running so reports always reflect the latest run only.

---

## 📊 Reports

### Playwright HTML Report

```bash
npm run report
```

Opens the built-in Playwright HTML report in your browser. Shows each test with:
- Pass/fail status per step
- Screenshots on failure
- Video recording on failure
- Full trace file for debugging

### Allure Report

```bash
# Step 1 — generate from latest results
npm run allure:generate

# Step 2 — open in browser
npm run allure:open

# Or use live server (auto-refresh as tests run)
npm run allure:serve
```

Allure report includes:
- Dashboard with pass/fail/skip breakdown
- Step-level timeline per test
- Screenshots attached on failure
- Test duration and trends
- Suite grouping by tag

### Cucumber HTML Report

After any cucumber run, open:
```
reports/cucumber-report.html
```

### Clean all generated reports manually

```bash
npm run clean
```

Wipes `allure-results/`, `allure-report/`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, and `reports/`.

## 🏷️ Tags

Tags control which tests run. Use `--grep` for Playwright and `--tags` for Cucumber.

### Playwright Tags

| Tag | Scope |
|---|---|
| `@smoke` | Critical happy path — fast, runs on every PR |
| `@regression` | Full coverage including edge cases |
| `@products` | All product module tests |
| `@create` | Create product tests |
| `@update` | Update product tests |
| `@delete` | Delete product tests |
| `@search` | Search and filter tests |
| `@pagination` | Pagination tests |
| `@network` | Network resilience tests |
| `@negative` | Negative/validation tests |
| `@auth` | Authentication tests |

```bash
# Single tag
npx playwright test --grep @smoke

# Combine tags (AND)
npx playwright test --grep "@products and @delete"

# Exclude a tag
npx playwright test --grep "@regression and not @network"
```

### Cucumber Tags

| Tag | Scope |
|---|---|
| `@smoke` | Core happy path BDD scenarios |
| `@regression` | Full BDD scenario suite |
| `@products` | Product-related scenarios |
| `@create` | Create product scenarios |
| `@negative` | Negative/validation scenarios |

```bash
# Single tag
npx cucumber-js --tags @smoke

# Combine tags
npx cucumber-js --tags "@smoke and @products"

# Exclude
npx cucumber-js --tags "not @regression"
```

---

## 📋 Logging

The framework uses Winston for structured step-level logging. Every significant action is logged automatically.

### Log Levels

| Level | When used |
|---|---|
| `info` | Step completion, navigation success, product created/deleted |
| `debug` | Fixture setup/teardown, internal state |
| `warn` | Non-blocking issues — cleanup failures, slow responses |
| `error` | Unhandled exceptions (auto-captured) |

### Sample Console Output

```
10:05:16 info [TestStep]      ▶ Login — sandboxuser1@gokwik.co
10:05:21 info [LoginPage]       Login successful
10:05:21 info [TestStep]      ▶ Switch merchant — 19h577u3p4be
10:05:24 info [DashboardPage]   Merchant switched to: 19h577u3p4be
10:05:33 info [TestStep]      ▶ Click Add product
10:05:34 info [TestStep]      ▶ Fill product title — Test-PRDN-1773116434915
10:05:34 info [TestStep]      ▶ Fill inventory SKU — SKN-1773116434915
10:05:35 info [TestStep]      ▶ Submit create product
10:05:37 info [ProductFormPage] Product created — ID: 17731164353929422
10:05:42 info [TestStep]      ▶ Search product — Test-PRDN-1773116434915
```

---

## 🧪 Test Data

All test data is generated fresh per test using `TestDataGenerator`:

```typescript
const data = TestDataGenerator.product();
// data.name        → 'Test-PRDN-1773116434915'       (timestamp-suffixed)
// data.sku         → 'SKN-1773116434915'
// data.updatedName → 'Test-PRDN-UPDATED-1773116434915'
```

**Rules:**
- Generated once per test, reused within that test
- Never shared across tests — each test owns its data
- Timestamp suffix prevents collision between parallel runs
- Never hardcoded in feature files — stored on `CRMWorld` and referenced in steps
- Credentials are never in test data — always sourced from `.env`

## 🏛️ Architecture

### Why Cucumber AND Playwright Spec files?

| Playwright Specs | Cucumber BDD |
|---|---|
| Technical edge cases | Business-readable happy paths |
| Network failures, race conditions | Stakeholder-facing scenarios |
| Boundary tests, negative validation | Acceptance criteria documentation |
| Deep assertion coverage | Feature behaviour specification |

Both layers share the **same Page Objects** — zero duplication of automation logic.

### Page Object Design

Every page object extends `BasePage` which provides:

```typescript
safeClick(locator, description)     // waits for visible, logs, wraps error
safeFill(locator, value, description) // clears first, fills, logs
waitForLoaderToDisappear()           // handles app loading states gracefully
```

### Fixture Strategy

| Fixture | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `authTest` | Logs in + switches to correct merchant before each test |
| `productTest` | Extends authTest, creates a product before test, deletes it after via UI |

### Test Isolation

Each test:
1. Gets its own browser context — no shared state between tests
2. Logs in fresh — auth is always verified, not assumed
3. Generates unique data — timestamp-based names prevent collisions
4. Cleans up its own data — tests never leave orphaned data

## 🔁 CI / CD

### Pipelines

| Pipeline | Trigger | What runs | Expected time |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smoke.yml` | Every PR to any branch | `@smoke` tagged Playwright tests | ~5 min |
| `regression.yml` | Push to `main` branch | Full Playwright suite + Cucumber | ~20 min |

### GitHub Secrets Required

Add these under `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions` in your GitHub repository:

| Secret Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` | App URL — `https://qa-mdashboard.dev.gokwik.in` |
| `LOGIN_EMAIL` | Test account email |
| `LOGIN_PASSWORD` | Test account password |
| `LOGIN_OTP` | OTP value for test environment |
| `MERCHANT_ID` | Merchant ID to switch to after login |

---

## 🗂️ Test Coverage

### Playwright Specs

| Spec File | Test Cases | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| `login.spec.ts` | Valid login, wrong password, wrong OTP, empty fields, redirect | `@smoke` `@regression` `@auth` |
| `create.spec.ts` | Title only, with category, with size variant, URL update, no-title validation, nav via menu | `@smoke` `@regression` `@negative` |
| `update.spec.ts` | Update name, verify listing, old name removed | `@regression` |
| `delete.spec.ts` | Delete from detail, auto-navigate after delete, bulk delete, cancel bulk delete | `@regression` |
| `search-filter.spec.ts` | Exact name search, no-results state, pagination default count | `@regression` `@pagination` |
| `network-resilience.spec.ts` | API failure on save, network abort handling | `@regression` `@network` |

### Cucumber BDD Scenarios

| Feature File | Scenarios |
|---|---|
| `login.feature` | Successful login, wrong OTP stays on screen, Next button disabled initially |
| `create-product.feature` | Required fields only, with size variant, no title validation, URL contains product ID |
| `manage-product.feature` | Update name, delete from detail, bulk delete, cancel bulk delete, search by name, no-match search |

## 🛠️ Extending the Framework

### Adding a new Page Object

1. Create `src/pages/<module>/<name>.page.ts` extending `BasePage`
2. Define locators as `private readonly` class properties
3. Implement action methods using `safeClick` / `safeFill`
4. Add assertion methods prefixed with `expect`

### Adding a new Playwright Spec

1. Create `tests/spec/<module>/<name>.spec.ts`
2. Import `authTest` or `productTest` from fixtures
3. Tag each test with `@smoke` or `@regression` and the module tag
4. Follow the pattern: setup → action → assertion → cleanup

### Adding a new Cucumber Scenario

1. Add the scenario to the relevant `.feature` file under `cucumber/features/`
2. Implement any new steps in `cucumber/step-definitions/products.steps.ts`
3. Store scenario-level state on `this` (CRMWorld), never in module-level variables
4. Never write Playwright/browser logic directly in step definitions — always delegate to page objects

### Adding a new environment variable

1. Add the variable to `.env.example` with a comment
2. Add the typed property to `config/env.config.ts`
3. Reference it via `config.<property>` throughout the codebase — never call `process.env` directly in tests
